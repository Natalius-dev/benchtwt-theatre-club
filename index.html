        <h2>Benchtwt Theatre Club</h2>
        <p>Th BenchTwt Academy is a server where fans of the Bench Trio can roleplay and talk to each other. It's set in a school and 
            there are clubs within it! Now The BenchTwt Theatre Club is one of those clubs. It's the perfect place for theatre kids to 
            just hang out with each other. The Club is also planning to do Passerine and Hamilton soon so be sure to look out for that. 
            The current club president is  ensalada#5440! The club also recently reached 100 members!
